There are datatypes we use in the Excel computation engine:
- "String"
- "Number"
- "Date"
- "Error"
- "Boolean"
This will help us keep track of the final result of the computation and the 
way it must be displayed.
When the value of a cell is retrieved from the workbook representation, it is parsed and we try to determine it's type. Due to the different date format that Google Spreadsheets offers for each country, I will provide support for the en_US locale until I find a more general solution.

Rules for Unary Operations:
+ operator: Do nothing
- Operator: -Date => -Number
	  : -Number=>-Number
 	  : -String=> if a conversion is possible,-parseFloat(String) else Error
	  : -Error=>Error
	  : -Boolean => -Number

Rules for Postfix Operators
	Number=>Number
	Date=>Number
	Boolean=>Boolean
	String=>String
	Error=>Error
