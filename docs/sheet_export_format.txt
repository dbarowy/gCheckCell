According to this https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html-service-communication#parameters_and_return_values
we can only pass primitives between GAS and the client side.
To solve this, I define the following JSON object to communicate workbook data between GAS and the client side.

/*
Everything we need to know about a sheet it is its name, the values and the formulas it contains
*/
Sheet:{
	-String name
	-String[][] values
	-String[][] formulas
}

/* 
Named Ranges are unique to the workbook. I think this is all the information we need to identify a named range.
*/
Named_Range:{
	- String name
	- String sheet
	- int startRow
	- int startCol
	- int endRow
	- int endCol
	- String[][] values
	- String[][] formulas
}

Workbook:{
  	- String name
	- Sheet[] sheets
	- Named_Range[] named_ranges
}

Data : {
	- Workbook active_book;
	- Workbook[] external_books;
}
