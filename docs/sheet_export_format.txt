According to this https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html-service-communication#parameters_and_return_values
we can only pass primitives between GAS and the client side.
To solve this, I define the following JSON object to communicate workbook data between GAS and the client side.

/*
Everything we need to know about a sheet it is its name, the values and the formulas it contains
*/
Sheet:{
	-String name
	-String[][] values
	-String[][] formulas
}

/* 
Named Ranges are unique to the workbook. I think this is all the information we need to identify a named range.
*/


Workbook:{
  	- String name
	- Sheet[] sheets
}

Data : {
	- Workbook active_book;
	- Workbook[] external_books;
}
